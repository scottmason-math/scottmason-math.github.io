Hi! I'm Scott Mason, a postdoctoral researcher in mathematics at [NYU Courant](https://math.nyu.edu/dynamic/people/postdocs/). My supervisor is [Roland Bauerschimdt](https://cims.nyu.edu/~bauerschmidt/). Before coming to Courant, I was a postdoc in the Statistical Laboratory at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk). 

I obtained my PhD in 2023 from KTH, working under the supervision of [Kurt Johansson](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RzdltIUAAAAJ&hl=sv), and my undergraduate/master's degrees from the University of Melbourne.

## Research interests
My mathematical interests lie primarily in probability theory, mathematical physics and analysis, in particular their applications to statistical mechanics. I have studied the sine-Gordon field - a massive, non-conformal field theory and its related integrability.
